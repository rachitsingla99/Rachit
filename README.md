I'm a passionate Cybersecurity Professional with expertise in threat intelligence, malware analysis, incident response, and risk assessment. With hands-on experience in SIEM (QRadar), EDR solutions (CrowdStrike, Carbon Black), and vulnerability management (Nessus, Qualys), I specialize in securing networks, detecting threats, and mitigating cyber risks.

## Objective

I recently completed my Post-Graduate Diploma in Computer Systems Technology â€“ Networking and have 2+ years of cybersecurity experience in threat intelligence, incident response, and vulnerability management. I'm now seeking a full-time cybersecurity role where I can apply my skills in SIEM, EDR, and digital forensics to enhance security operations and mitigate threats.
